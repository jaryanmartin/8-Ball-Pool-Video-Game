# 8-Ball Pool Video Game

An 8-Ball Pool game implemented in C and VHDL for the Zynq-7000 SoC.
This project demonstrates both hardware and software design through real-time graphics, embedded control, and physics-based game logic.


## Features
- Real-time ball physics and collision detection  
- VGA display and hardware rendering through custom VHDL modules  
- Audio feedback and multi-mode gameplay (8-Ball, 9-Ball, Quickfire)  
- Integrated hardware/software design using Vivado and Vitis


## How to Run
1. Open the project in **Vivado** and generate the bitstream.  
2. Export the hardware including the `.xsa` file to **Vitis**.  
3. Import the `sw/` folder into Vitis as an application project.  
4. Build and program the **Zynq-7000** board.  
5. Connect a monitor (VGA/HDMI) and enjoy the game.
